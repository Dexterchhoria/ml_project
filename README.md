# **Language Detector**
This project is a language detection tool built using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a Naive Bayes classifier combined with text vectorization to accurately identify the language of a given input text.

Key Components:
CountVectorizer: Transforms text data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.
Multinomial Naive Bayes: A classification algorithm used to predict the language based on the text features.
Train-Test Split: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Performance:
The model achieves a test accuracy of 95.44%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying the language of short text samples.

Usage:
Input a text in an unknown language.
The model will output the predicted language with a high degree of accuracy.
This project is ideal for anyone looking to implement or explore language detection using machine learning.
